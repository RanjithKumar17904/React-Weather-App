# React Weather App

This project is a simple weather application built with **React**. It allows users to search for a city and retrieve real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions. The app uses a weather API to fetch the latest weather information.

## Features

- **City-based weather search:** Enter a city name to get the current weather information.
- **Real-time data:** Displays up-to-date weather data.
- **Responsive design:** Works across all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Simple and clean UI:** Focused on ease of use and readability.
